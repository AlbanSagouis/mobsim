#' MoBspatial: A package for spatial analysis of scale-dependent biodiversity changes.
#'
#' The package includes functions to simulated species distributions in space
#' as well as for the analysis of spatially-explicit data, where each individual
#' is described by its xy-coordinates as well as a species label.
