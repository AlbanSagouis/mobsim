Title: Spatial Simulation and Scale-Dependent Analysis of Biodiversity Changes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Felix May
Maintainer: Felix May <felix.may@posteo.de>
Description: Tools for the simulation, analysis and sampling of spatial
    biodiversity data. In the simulation tools user define the numbers of
    species and individuals, the species abundance distribution and species
    aggregation. Functions for analysis include species rarefaction 
    and accumulation curves, species-area relationships and the distance
    decay of similarity.
