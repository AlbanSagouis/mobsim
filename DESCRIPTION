Version: 0.1.0
Author: Felix May
Maintainer: Felix May <felix.may@idiv.de>
Description: Functions to study scale-dependent biodiversity changes. The
    package includes functions to simulated species distributions in space
    with controlled abundance distributions as well as controlled intraspecific
    aggregation. For analysis there are functions for species rarefaction and
    accumulation curves, species-area relationships and endemics-area relationships.
