\usage{
Sim.Thomas.Coords(abund.vec, sigma = 0.02, mother.points = NA,
  cluster.points = NA, xrange = c(0, 1), yrange = c(0, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{abund.vec}{integer vector with species abundances}

\item{sigma}{numeric vector of length = 1 or length = 2. Mean displacement
(along each coordinate axes) of a point from its mother point (= cluster centre).
Therefore sigma correlates with cluster radius. When length(sigma) == 1
all species have the same cluster radius.When length(sigma) == 2 a linear
relationship between species-specific sigma values and log(relative abundance)
is simulated. Thereby sigma[1] is the cluster parameter for the least abundant
species and sigma[2] the cluster parameter for the most abundant species.
When sigma of any species is more than twice as large as the largest
plot dimension, than a random Poisson distribution is simulated, which is more
efficient than a Thomas cluster process. The parameter \code{sigma} corresponds to the
\code{scale} parameter of \code{\link[spatstat]{rThomas}}.}

\item{mother.points}{numeric - number of mother points (= cluster centres).
If this is a single value, all species have the same number of clusters.
For example \code{mother.points = 1} can be used to simulate only one cluster
per species, which then represents the complete species range.
If \code{mother.points} is a vector of the same length as \code{abund.vec},
each species has a specific number of clusters. If no value is provided, the
number of clusters is determined from the abundance and the number of points
per cluster (\code{cluster.points}).}

\item{cluster.points}{numeric - mean number of points per cluster. If this is
a single value, species have the same average number of points per cluster.
If this is a vector of the same length as \code{abund.vec}, each species has
a specific mean number of points per cluster.  If no value is provided, the
number of points per cluster is determined from the abundance and from
\code{mother.points}.  The parameter \code{cluster.points} corresponds to the
\code{mu} parameter of \code{\link[spatstat]{rThomas}}.}

\item{xrange}{numeric vector of length 2 - extent of the community in x-direction}

\item{yrange}{numeric vector of length 2 - extent of the community in y-direction}
}
\value{
A community object as defined by \code{\link{community}}.
}
\description{
Add clumped (aggregated) positions to a species abundance distribution.
Clumping is simulated using a Thomas cluster process, also known as Poisson
cluster process (Morlon et al. 2008, Wiegand & Moloney 2014)
}
\details{
To generate a Thomas cluster process of a single species this
function uses a C++ re-implementation if the function
\code{\link[spatstat]{rThomas}} in the package \code{spatstat}.

There is an inherent link between the parameters \code{abund.vec},
\code{mother.points}, and \code{cluster.points}. For every species the
abundance has to be equal to the product of the number of clusters
(\code{mother.points}) times the numbers of points per cluster
(\code{mother.points}).

\deqn{abundance = mother.points * cluster.points}

Accordingly, if one of the parameters is provided the other one is directly
calculated from the abundance. Values for \code{mother.points} override values
for \code{cluster.points}. If none of the parameters is specified, it is assumed
that for every species there is a similar number of clusters and of points
per cluster.

\deqn{mother.points = cluster.points = \sqrt(abundance),}

In this case rare species have few clusters with few points per
cluster, while abundant species have many clusters with many points per cluster.

abund <- c(10,20,50,100)
sim1 <- Sim.Thomas.Coords(abund, sigma = 0.02)
plot(sim1)

# Simulate species "ranges"
sim2 <- Sim.Thomas.Coords(abund, sigma = 0.02, mother.points = 1)
plot(sim2)

# Equal numbers of points per cluster
sim3 <- Sim.Thomas.Coords(abund, sigma = 0.02, cluster.points = 5)
plot(sim3)
